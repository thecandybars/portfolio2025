          <p>
            GarageID is a revolutionary platform designed to bring car
            enthusiasts together by showcasing car profiles, managing races, and
            fostering a vibrant social network. The project began with a bold
            vision to create a seamless experience for car lovers, and as the
            lead developer, I was instrumental in turning that vision into
            reality.

          <ul id="image_list">
            <li><img src="images/GID-detail-01.jpeg" alt="My Home" /></li>
            <li><img src="images/GID-detail-02.jpeg" alt="My Home" /></li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            From the initial stages, I spearheaded the development of the app,
            creating the visual concept, designing the database system, and
            coding both the front-end and back-end components. This groundwork
            set the foundation for a robust and scalable platform. As the team
            grew, I transitioned to focus on front-end development,
            collaborating with a graphic designer and a back-end developer to
            refine the app's functionality and enhance the user interface. This
            collaboration resulted in a dynamic and engaging experience for
            users.

            Key features of GarageID include a comprehensive ticket purchasing
            system, advanced forms for collecting and validating user data, and
            social tools that allow users to post text and images, reply, and
            react to posts. Additionally, I developed sophisticated photo
            management tools to streamline the uploading, viewing, and
            manipulation of images, enriching the app's interactive
            capabilities. By bridging the gap between design and technical
            implementation, I contributed significantly to UI/UX improvements
            and optimized data organization strategies for better client-side
            accessibility.
