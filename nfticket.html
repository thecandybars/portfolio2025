          <p>
            NFTickets was a cutting-edge marketplace aimed to transform the way
            tickets are bought, sold, and managed. Built on blockchain
            technology, the platform delivered tickets as NFTs, ensuring
            security, transparency, and authenticity. As a front-end developer
            behind this project, I aimed to redefine the event experience by
            combining blockchain innovation with a user-centric approach.

          </div>
          <ul id="image_list">
            <li><img src="images/NFTicket-detail-01.jpeg" alt="My Home" /></li>
            <li><img src="images/NFTicket-detail-02.jpeg" alt="My Home" /></li>
            <li><img src="images/NFTicket-detail-03.jpeg" alt="My Home" /></li>
            <li><img src="images/NFTicket-detail-04.jpeg" alt="My Home" /></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The platform allowed users to explore, search, and select events
            across music, theater, and sports, while also empowering them to
            upload their own events to the blockchain. This dynamic feature
            fostered a community-driven ecosystem where event organizers and
            attendees alike benefited from seamless ticket management. By
            leveraging the unique properties of NFTs, NFTickets eliminated
            counterfeit tickets and introduced new possibilities for ticket
            resale, ownership and collecting.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this project, I focused on front-end development, connecting the
            app to the MetaMask wallet to enable secure user authentication and
            transactions. I implemented features to retrieve ticket information
            directly from the blockchain and managed the transaction process for
            purchasing NFT tickets. These integrations ensured a seamless and
            reliable experience for users navigating the decentralized system.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the final group project for my Fullstack bootcamp in 2022.
            Unfortunately, the backend appears to be down, so the live app is
            not working properly.
